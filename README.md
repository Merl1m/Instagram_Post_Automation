# Instagram Post Automation

This is a simple instagram post upload automation script using selenium.

This script is specifically crafted for my system meaning you will need to change a few settings.

First step is to install the modules required from requirements.txt with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

Second step is to change the browser settings in the script according to your needs, I have used Brave browser with chrome driver (version 122).
If you are using Microsoft Edge, you will need Edge Driver, and so check with browser you use and install appropriate drivers.
Make sure your browser version and driver version is the same.

Final step is to add in your username and password, set the IMAGE_PATH to the file you want to upload, give a discription in the DISCRIPTION variable and you are good to run the code.
